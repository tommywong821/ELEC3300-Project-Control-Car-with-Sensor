# ELEC3300-Project-Control-Car-with-Sensor

## Project Details

The project involves building a remote control car using two STM-32 development boards, one serving as the master and the other as the slave. The car will be controlled using a joystick and will also be able to collect environmental data, which will be sent back to the user. The data can be viewed on the LCD monitor of the master STM-32 development board.

## Hardward Requirement

- 2 STM-32 Development Board
- HC05 Master/Slave control
- Joystick module
- Gas sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor
- L298N Motor Driver Module
